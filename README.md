# GP Function

**GP Function** implements a multi-objective Genetic Programming (GP) strategy based on NSGA-II.
In this repository the GP Function EML algorithm executable into a *cCube* container without changing the source code.
For this reason we only customized the [.ccube](.ccube) file.
The environment variables define how the *cCube* daemon can interact with the EML algorithm and its outcome for both the learning and prediction phases.
